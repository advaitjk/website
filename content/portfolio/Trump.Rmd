# Trump's Approval Margins

We start by importing the data files and cleaning them up ahead of our analysis.    

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('csv', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# Quickly view data set.
# glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Data set cleaned.
approval_polllist_clean <- approval_polllist %>%
    select(c(enddate, samplesize, adjusted_approve, adjusted_disapprove)) %>% 
    mutate(approval_difference = adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove)
approval_polllist_clean

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

> The Average net approval rating of Trump along with the 95% confidence intervals are calculated below.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# The data set of approval ratings are cleaned along with finding the confidence intervals.
Trump_Approval <- approval_polllist_clean %>%
  mutate(enddate = mdy(enddate),
         year = year(enddate),
         week = week(enddate)
         ) %>%
  group_by(year, week) %>% 
        summarise(Weekly_difference = sum(approval_difference),
                  avg_difference = mean(approval_difference),
                  se_Trump = sd(approval_difference)/sqrt(n()),
                  t_crit = qt(0.975, n() - 1),
                  lower_CIs = (avg_difference - t_crit * se_Trump),
                  upper_CIs = (avg_difference + t_crit * se_Trump)
                  )
Trump_Approval
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

> As seen in the approval plot, mid-April shows that the confidence intervals are closer compared to larger confidence intervals in mid August. As standard error is proportional to the variance of trump's approval ratings, national events that happened mid August, such as the BLM protests and the handling of the Covid crisis, has made the public's view of Trump far more polarized. Because of this, the standard errors increase widening the confidence intervals.
