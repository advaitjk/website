# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Here we wish to doa  small experiment, we want to see whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not by seeing if the confidence intervals overlap.

## Confidence Intervals


```{r directors, out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("csv", "movies.csv"))

comparison_data <- movies %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg")) %>% 
  select(c(director, title, rating)) %>%
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(rating),
            sd = sd(rating),
            count = n(),
            se = sd/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se,
            lower = mean - t_critical * se,
            upper = mean + t_critical * se
            )

comparison_data

data_plot <- comparison_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(color = c("#00bfc4", "#f8766d"))) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(
                    y = reorder(director, mean),
                    xmin = lower, 
                    xmax = upper),
                size = 2,
                width = .05
                ) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mean, y = director), size = 4) +
  geom_rect(xmin = 7.27,
            xmax = 7.33,
            ymin = 0,
            ymax = 100,
            alpha = .7,
            fill = "#c8c8c8",
            color = "#c8c8c8"
            ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "",
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMBD ratings?",
    subtitle = "95% confidence interval overlap",
    x = "Mean IMBD Rating",
    y = ""
  ) +
  annotate("text", x = 6.93, y = 1.1, size = 8, label = "6.93") +
  annotate("text", x = 6.53, y = 1.1, size = 5, label = "6.53") +
  annotate("text", x = 7.33, y = 1.1, size = 5, label = "7.33") +
  annotate("text", x = 7.27, y = 2.1, size = 5, label = "7.27") +
  annotate("text", x = 7.57, y = 2.1, size = 8, label = "7.57") +
  annotate("text", x = 7.87, y = 2.1, size = 5, label = "7.87")

data_plot

```


## Hypothesis Testing

After inspecting the confidence intervals, we conducted hypothesis testing using both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where we assumed zero difference between the two.

First we noted down our null and alternative hypotheses:

> `H0`: Spielberg's and Burton's means are statistically similar
>
> `Ha`: Spielberg's and Burton's means are statistically dissimilar

> We can also write this as:
> 
> `H0`: mu_s - mu_b = 0
> 
> `Ha`: mu_s - mu_b != 0 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tests <- movies %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg")) %>% 
  group_by(director)

ttest <- t.test(rating ~ director, data = tests, var.equal = TRUE)
ttest

null_disttrib <- tests %>% 
  specify(rating ~ director) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",
            order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) 

#null_disttrib

mean_diff <- tests %>% 
  specify(rating ~ director) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",
            order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))
mean_diff

visualise(null_disttrib, bins = 10) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = mean_diff, direction = "right")

null_disttrib %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = mean_diff, direction = "right")
```

> Since our p-values are smaller than our alpha of 5%, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
> Therefore, Spielberg's mean IMBD rating is statistically different from Burton's IMBD rating
