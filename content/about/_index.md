title: About Me
---

Taking correct decisions is always hard and often requires us to learn both new hard and soft skills. Thankfully, Iâ€™m a life long learner with a thing for tough challenges!

Having recently completed my undergraduate degree in Finance, I have embarked on a journey of a lifetime at LBS to attain a Masters in Analytics and Management where I hope to bridge the gap between the world of finance and data analytics. This unique combination of backgrounds is actively equipping me with an extensive set of tools which enable me to extract valuable financial insight from data sets whom to most just seem like noise. Hence, removing any element of gut feeling from the process of decision making.
